# JarvisVertexAI Implementation Notes

## Important: Core Swift Files to Create on macOS

This repository contains the UI components and test suite. The following core implementation files need to be created when setting up the project on macOS. Full implementations were provided in the conversation history but not included as separate files to keep the repository focused.

## Required Core Files (Create in Xcode)

### 1. Core/Database/ObjectBoxManager.swift
**Purpose**: Local database management with encryption

**Key Features**:
- ObjectBox initialization with AES-256 encryption
- Session and transcript management
- Vector similarity search for memories
- 30-day auto-cleanup
- Export and deletion capabilities

### 2. Core/Privacy/PHIRedactor.swift  
**Purpose**: PHI/PII detection and redaction

**Key Patterns to Detect**:
- Social Security Numbers
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Medical record numbers
- Physical addresses

### 3. Core/VertexAI/AudioSession.swift
**Purpose**: Mode 1 - Native audio streaming

**Key Components**:
- Gemini Live API integration
- Zero retention configuration
- CMEK encryption setup
- Ephemeral session management

### 4. Core/VertexAI/LocalSTTTTS.swift
**Purpose**: Mode 2 - On-device voice processing

**Key Features**:
- iOS Speech framework integration
- On-device speech recognition
- Local TTS synthesis
- Text-only Gemini API calls

### 5. Core/VertexAI/MultimodalChat.swift
**Purpose**: Mode 3 - Text and file handling

**Key Capabilities**:
- Text chat with Gemini
- Image upload and processing
- Document handling
- Ephemeral file management (24-hour deletion)

## Implementation Reference

The complete implementations for these files are available in the original conversation history where the project was developed. Each file includes:

- Full privacy configuration
- Error handling
- Audit logging
- PHI redaction integration
- Proper cleanup mechanisms

## Quick Setup Guide

1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FocusedAlpha99/JarvisVertexAI.git
   cd JarvisVertexAI
   ```

2. **Create Xcode project**
   - New iOS App
   - SwiftUI interface
   - iOS 17.0 minimum

3. **Add Package Dependencies** (via Xcode)
   - ObjectBox Swift
   - Google Cloud SDK (if available)
   - CryptoSwift
   - KeychainAccess

4. **Create Core Files**
   - Create folder structure: Core/Database, Core/Privacy, Core/VertexAI
   - Add the 5 core Swift files listed above
   - Copy implementations from conversation history

5. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit with your Vertex AI credentials
   ```

6. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -scheme JarvisVertexAI
   ```

## Privacy Configuration Checklist

- [ ] Vertex AI Project ID configured
- [ ] CMEK key created and configured
- [ ] Zero Data Retention request filed
- [ ] HIPAA BAA signed (if applicable)
- [ ] OAuth client ID configured
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] ObjectBox encryption key generated

## Testing Priority

1. **Privacy Tests** - Verify PHI redaction and encryption
2. **Database Tests** - Confirm local-only storage
3. **API Tests** - Validate zero retention flags
4. **OAuth Tests** - Check minimal scope implementation
5. **UI Tests** - Ensure all three modes function

## Support Resources

- Full test suite: `COMPLETE_TEST_SUITE.txt`
- Project structure: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- GitHub setup: `GITHUB_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
- Privacy reference: See conversation history for detailed compliance configurations

## Notes

- All sensitive data remains on-device
- No cloud sync or analytics
- PHI automatically redacted before API calls
- 30-day automatic data cleanup
- Comprehensive audit logging

For complete implementation details, refer to the conversation history where each component was fully developed with privacy-first architecture.
